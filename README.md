# Equipment Management System

A React-based Equipment Management System that allows users to manage **Equipment Classes** and their **Properties** within an enterprise hierarchy.
The application uses **Redux Toolkit for global state management**, **Ant Design for UI components**, and integrates with **JSONPlaceholder public APIs** to simulate backend operations.

---

# Project Overview

This system provides a dashboard to manage equipment data in an enterprise structure.

Hierarchy Structure:

Enterprise → Site → Area → Equipment Classes → Properties

Users can:

• View and manage equipment classes
• Create and update equipment classes
• Select an equipment class to manage its properties
• Create and update equipment properties
• View data in responsive tables with sorting and filtering

The application simulates backend CRUD operations using the JSONPlaceholder REST API.

# Technologies Used

React (Vite)
Redux Toolkit
React Redux
Axios
Ant Design
Day.js

---

# Architecture

The project follows a **modular architecture** separating UI, state management, and API layers.

# Redux State Structure

The application uses three Redux slices.

### Hierarchy Slice

Stores static enterprise hierarchy information.

```
enterprise
site
area
```

This data is displayed in the **TopBar**.

---

### Equipment Class Slice

Manages equipment class records.

```
items
selectedItem
status
error
```

Handles:

* Fetch equipment classes
* Create equipment class
* Update equipment class
* Delete equipment class

---

### Properties Slice

Manages properties belonging to a selected equipment class.

```
items
status
error
```

Handles:

* Fetch properties
* Create property
* Update property
* Delete property

---

# API Integration

The application uses the **JSONPlaceholder public REST API** to simulate backend operations.

Base URL:

```
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
```

Endpoints used:

Equipment Classes:

```
GET    /posts
POST   /posts
PUT    /posts/{id}
DELETE /posts/{id}
```

Properties:

```
GET    /comments?postId={equipmentClassId}
POST   /comments
PUT    /comments/{id}
DELETE /comments/{id}
```

Redux `createAsyncThunk` is used to handle asynchronous API requests.

• Load equipment classes from API
• Create new equipment class
• Update existing equipment class
• Delete equipment class
• Row selection in table
• Form validation

Properties Management

• Load properties when an equipment class is selected
• Create property
• Update property
• Delete property

UI Features

• Responsive layout

---

# Business Rules

The application follows the **autoId convention**:

| autoId Value | Operation              |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 0            | Create new record      |
| >0           | Update existing record |

Immutable fields after creation:

Equipment Class

• id
• effectiveStartDate

Properties

• id
• effectiveStartDate

These fields are disabled in edit mode.

---

# Date Validation Rules

• effectiveStartDate is auto-generated during creation
• effectiveEndDate must be after effectiveStartDate
• Date comparisons are handled using **Day.js**

---

# Responsive Design

The application uses Ant Design's responsive grid system.

Desktop:

Form and table appear side-by-side.

Mobile:

Components stack vertically for better usability.

---
